v.4.1.0-Preview1
- Improved operation performance for IPv4 address range.

v.4.0.0
- Implement "IEquatable<T>" interface and "GetHashCode()".

v.3.2.2
- Fix: Parsing non-linear subnet mask should be failed.

v.3.2.1
- Fix implementation problem (Remove useless GetAddressBytes)

v.3.2.0
 - Fix: Bits.GE/LE operations are reversed.(use GtE/LtE instead.)
 - Improve: Bts.GtE/LtE methods are more faster now.

v.3.1.1 - Fix: Error if parsing IP address includes some spaces.

v.3.1.0 - Support parsing for IPv4 mapped to IPv6 address range.

v.3.0.0 - Sign the assembly. (make it to strong-named assembly.)

v.2.2.0 - Enhance: IPv4 shortcut notation support (like "192.168.0.0-255").

v.2.1.1 - Fix: Error if parsing IP address with scope id in the end.

v.2.1.0 - Enhance: Add "IsEqual" and "Decrement" methods to "Bits" utility class.

v.2.0.0 - [BREAKING CHANGE] Truncate .NET 4.0 support.
        - Enhance: can serialize/deserialize json text by JSON.NET

v.1.6.2 - Support: .NET Standard 1.4 (.NET Core) and UWP

v.1.6.1 - Fix: Add some parameter checks for throwing ArgumentNullException

v.1.6.0 - Enhance: Add "ToCidrString()" and "GetprefixLength()" method.

v.1.5.0 - Enhance: Add constructors variation / Save memory usage.

v.1.4.0 - Enhance: Add IEnumerable<IPAddress> support.

v.1.2.1 - Fix: "Parse()" and "TryParse()" methods throw IndexOutOfRangeException when bit mask length is invalid at CIDR format.

v.1.2.0 - Enhance: Add "Parse()" and "TryParse()" methods. (Instead, the constructor which has one string argument is obsoleted.)

v.1.1.0 - Enhance: Add "Contains()" method overload version of IPAddressRange argument.

v.1.0.6 - Fix Package: Repackage with Release build. (1.0.5 was Debug build)

v.1.0.5 - Fix: IPv4 CIDR range ".../32" causes crush.

v.1.0.4 - Enhance: support bit mask range not only CIDR range.

v.1.0.3 - Fix: Can not parse the address which contains hex string.
